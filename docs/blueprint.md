# **App Name**: Visionary Transit Guardian

## Core Features:

- Real-time Blind Spot Monitoring: Display real-time status of blind spots with color-coded safety levels (safe, warning, danger) and visual/audio alerts.
- Distance and TTC Indicators: Show the distance of nearby objects and Time-to-Collision (TTC) for risk assessment.
- Object Detection Cards: Identify and display nearby objects like bikes, cars, and pedestrians.
- What-If Scenario Simulation: Simulate different scenarios (bike entering blind spot, sudden overtaking vehicle, pedestrian walking close) with dynamic updates to the dashboard. Allows user control over which of several scenarios are being simulated.
- Sensor Data Simulation: Simulate sensor data streams using mock datasets and randomized realistic distance/speed values via API endpoints.
- Alert Prioritization Tool: Utilize AI as a tool to prioritize alerts based on Time-to-Collision (TTC) using a priority queue.  LLM reasoning ensures that critical alerts are managed efficiently and false alarms are minimized.
- Tutorial/Education Page: Explain how blind spot detection works, the underlying math, and data structures using diagrams and visuals.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#2962FF) to convey a sense of security and smart technology.
- Background color: Dark gray (#2A3744) for a modern, automotive-inspired dashboard theme.
- Accent color: Bright orange (#FF9100) for alerts and important indicators to grab the driver's attention.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' for a modern, neutral, easy-to-read style that suits a dashboard interface.
- Use clear and concise icons for different objects (pedestrians, vehicles, bikes) and system states (safe, warning, danger).
- Design a responsive layout that resembles a real bus control panel, with clear visual hierarchy and easy-to-access information.
- Incorporate smooth, subtle animations to indicate changes in risk level or status updates.
